• The food system employs the most people in many developing countries in both self and wage employment, and will continue to do so during the time period set to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, and thereafter. Self and wage employment in farming still generates a large share of rural incomes and can have large poverty-reducing effects.

• The food system extends beyond farm production to include activities along value chains, such as food processing, transportation, retailing, restaurants, and other services. In many countries, the off-farm aspect of the food system accounts for a large share of the economy’s manufacturing and services sectors. While the employment share in farming tends to decline as per capita incomes rise, the share in food manufacturing and services tends to increase.

• Increasing the number and inclusiveness of jobs will require attention to food system growth, employment intensity, and inclusion of youth and women. Urbanization and per capita income growth offers significant new opportunities in non-cereal products and in new jobs in the food system beyond the farm. Inclusion of women and the growing number of youth into food system jobs can raise productivity and improve social harmony.
